# Ethical Software and Systems Engineering

This repository contains artifacts of the practial course **Ethical Systems and Software Engineering** which was held during the winter semester 2019/2020 by the chair for Software and Systems Engineering (Prof. Pretschner).   

In this course, we worked together in groups of 4 students. Our task was to develop 5 Jira plugins and evaluate them ethically.

This repository contains the source code of the Jira plugins we developed as well as the corresponding documents that discuss if the features are ethically appropiate. For setting up this project locally, a TUM Jira access is needed.

For a quick overview of our work, take a look at the two presentation slide decks.
